			In 2018, a man by the name of Tony T. had an idea for a friend: Get them into fitness instead of going to D&D.
			That friend did not take the plunge into the realm of dumbells and squat racks until they were told that it would better them in the long run, and maybe get them out of the house a bit.
			Of course, he had to find ways of making it fun and enjoyable; but also make it compelling enough for his friend to keep at it with himself and others joining along on his journey.
			<br />
			This was the background story behind one of the most ambitious ideas for those looking to get better acquainted with the Swole life without leaving the nerd life.
